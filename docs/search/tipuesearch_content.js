This helps me to keep track of where I am when switching from prod, staging and dev, where otherwise every site looks the same.  I've found the colors prevent me from making mistakes.

Installation   Download and unzip this module into your modules directory. Goto Administer > Site Building > Modules and enable this module.   Configuration  Unless defined as seen below, the site role is always prod. So, except in production environments, you must add either of the following to your settings.local.php file to indicate the site role for that environment.  For local developement add  !defined('DRUPAL_ENV_ROLE') &amp;&amp; define('DRUPAL_ENV_ROLE', 'dev');   For a staging site add  !defined('DRUPAL_ENV_ROLE') &amp;&amp; define('DRUPAL_ENV_ROLE', 'staging');   Be aware that modules can alter this value using loft_deploy_site_role_alter().  Should I Enable on Production?  Yes, usually.  If you keep this enabled on production, then you will not have to do anything when you copy your database to your local or staging environments.  If you do not keep it enabled, then you will have to remember to manually enable this module every time you sync your database.  This is not realistic.  Alternatively, you may automate the enabling of this module when your database is synced, but my vote is to just keep it enabled everywhere, since this is the simplest and most reliable.  This module has no measurable affect on a production website as it's been highly optimized for speed, so that idea should not deter you.  Site Role \/ Border Color   Each instance of your website is one of: production, staging or dev. The color of the border around the non-production sites informs you as to it's role.  There's one more distinction between a site role dev with master branch, and a site role dev with a develop branch; this adds a fourth color. Obviously, production instances will not have a border. You will need to flush Drupal caches each time you change your site role in settings.php.   Default Colors  SITE ROLE - GIT BRANCH - COLOR prod        n\/a         n\/a staging     n\/a         green staging     feature     orange dev         master      pink dev         develop     aqua dev         feature     yellow   Info Title  At the bottom of the page, you will see a readout of information, the title. By default this will display the site role, and the gitflow parent and current git branch, if you are using git.  Click this title to hide the visual border until next request.  Click while holding down CMD or CTRL to hide it for 10 minutes.  The duration of this can be controlled using settings.php, e.g.:  \/\/ Define the number of seconds to disable the border when clicking the metakey. $conf['loft_deploy_meta_timeout'] = 600   You may alter the title that is displayed at the bottom of the screen by adding the following to settings.local.php or settings.php, where the token !site_role will print the site role.  Other tokens are: !git and !gitflow.  $conf['loft_deploy_site_title'] = '!site_role - !git &gt; !gitflow'   Advanced Theming  Refer to .loft-deploy and it's classes for css overriding.  You may add additional css classes to .loft-deploy in settings.local.php, e.g.,  $conf['loft_deploy_css_class'][] = 'my-cool-class';   You may explicitely set the border color like this:  $conf['loft_deploy_border_color'] = '#BD8FDB'   You may explicitely set the text color like this:  $conf['loft_deploy_title_color'] = '#fff'   Gotchas   If your site role changes, you may need to empty all caches to see the changes appear.   Always Hide the Border  Add the following to settings.local.php and the border will not show, ever, for any reason.  Why would you do this? Not sure.  $conf['loft_deploy_border'] = FALSE;  ","tags":"","url":"README.html"},{"title":"Tasklist","text":"  - [ ] ld--roadmap: Fix the delay caused by deleting files at beginning of compile. - [ ] ld--todos: a task list item - [ ] ld--todos: a task list item @w-10 - [ ] demos--md_extra: Todo items will get aggregated automatically @w10 - [ ] ld--todos: a task list item @w10 - [ ] ld--todos: a task list item @w10.1  ","tags":"","url":"_tasklist.html"},{"title":"Search Results","text":" ","tags":"","url":"search--results.html"}]};
